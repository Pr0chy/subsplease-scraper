# subsplease-scraper

A python script to scrape SubsPlease

## Description

This script is used for scraping SubsPlease, however it has an option to generate anilist entries as well. Having said that I do not recommend to use that functionality as its broken right now, if you want to get properly converted SubsPlease entries to AniList IDs please download this JSON [file](https://github.com/ProchyGaming/subsplease-scraper/blob/main/ani_subs.json), which is automatically updated with new entries from SubsPlease.

However if some brave soul would like to take a crack at re-writing the season generating function, pull requests are more than welcome.
This script requires the anilist-helper [library](https://github.com/ProchyGaming/anilist-helper) for the convertion process.

Recap episodes are omitted, because, well who likes those anyways
